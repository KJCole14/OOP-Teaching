                              What is OOP?

object oriented programming (OOP) is a style or method of coding based off of the concept of objects.

Objects can contain information (properties) or code (methods).

Using objects, we can essentially have data and corresponding behaviors wrapped up in a single block of code.

Using OOP, objects are self-containing blocks of code.

Objects are the building blocks of applications that use an API to interact with one another
essentially using a "middle man" outside of these objects to communicate

Was developed as a way to organize code and easily maintain it.
